# Authentication and authorization

Users are alowed to work with the application but when they want to pay for an order they must login to the application. There's two kinds of authentications in the application.

- OTP (One time password)
- OAuth

## OTP

Users will be able to login or register to the application just by intering their own phone number. and then they will get a one time password to login or register. If the user has registered before he/she will be login after intering the code, If the user didn't register before the user will be redirect to the register page and then after that they can continue to work with the application.

### Registration 

We just ask user's name in the registeration process.

## OAuth

Users also will be able to user their Google/Apple account for authentication and they will be login to the applicarion and continue to work with the application.

## User profile

When users registered to the application they will be able to edit their name and avatar.
